    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Caption generation is an important tool for image retrieval as many forms of retrieval rely on natural language representations of data. As the number of images on the internet continues to increase (many without any form of caption or tag), it will become increasingly important to generate these captions in a fast manner. Fast implementations will also allow more detailed captions and have applications in assisting the visually impaired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general algorithm we will follow is that proposed in a 2015 University of Toronto/Montreal [paper](http://kelvinxu.github.io/projects/capgen.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The major steps (2 and 3 above) where we will derive our parallel speedup are the convolutional neural network and the recurrent neural network. We can use the fact that nodes within each layer of a neural network are independent as the basis of our optimization.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some challenges we expect to face are understanding Halide and the caption generation algorithm. We therefore expect to face some issues in porting the original algorithm to C++. Although nodes within a layer are independent in neural networks (providing much parallelism), RNNâ€™s have a component where each output depends on the previous time step. This is inherently serial and will limit the potential parallelism.\n"

However, we will be using techniques from past 418 projects to inspire the parallelization of the convolution feature extraction and RNN implementation in Halide/C++. As of now, we have a paper and Theano code to use as reference found [here](http://kelvinxu.github.io/projects/capgen.html). We plan to use this code in order to help shape our algorithm to make it as robust as possible.\n"
